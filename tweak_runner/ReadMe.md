# Tweak Shader Runner 

A simple demo application for the tweak shader library. It watches changes to a tweak shader file and displays errors as they arise. A few examples are available under `tweak_shader_examples` in the root directory.

The ui is powered by Egui.

## Usage

```
runner --file <tweak_shader_file>
```
